# Changelog

## 0.5.0

### Features
- ClaudeWatch now inspects file content sent through the `Write` and `Edit` tools, not just `Bash` commands. Destructive primitives hidden inside a script file (e.g. `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force /` in a `.ps1` that gets executed later via `pwsh ./cleanup.ps1`) are now caught at write time — clicking "approve" on an opaque script invocation is no longer the only line of defense. For `Edit`, the engine reconstructs the full post-edit file content before matching, so a small fragment that introduces a destructive call still trips the rule.
- New `watch-pwsh` rule set covers destructive PowerShell across both inline `pwsh -Command "..."` invocations and `.ps1` / `.psm1` / `.psd1` file contents. Block rules: `Format-Volume`, `Clear-Disk`, `Restart-Computer`, `Stop-Computer`, `Invoke-WebRequest | iex`, plus `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force` inside script files. Ask rules: inline `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force` (with `~/.cache/`, `/tmp/`, `/var/tmp/` excepted), other `Remove-Item` variants, `Stop-Process -Force`, and overwrites of sensitive paths like `/etc/`, `~/.ssh/`, `~/.aws/`.
- New `watch-python` rule set covers destructive Python across both inline `python3 -c "..."` invocations and `.py` file contents. Block rules: `shutil.rmtree` at filesystem roots (`/`, `~`, `$HOME`), `pickle.loads`, `__import__('os').system` / `popen`, and `subprocess` calls with `shell=True` plus a destructive payload. Ask rules: other `shutil.rmtree`, `os.remove` / `os.unlink`, `os.system`, generic `shell=True`, `eval(`, `exec(`.
- Rule-set YAML now supports two new backwards-compatible fields. Per-rule `target: bash | file-content` (default `bash`) selects which input the rule matches against — bash commands or written/edited file content. Per-rule-set `extensions: [.ext, ...]` (e.g. `['.ps1', '.psm1', '.psd1']`) gates file-content rules by file extension so the engine only evaluates Python rules against `.py` files, PowerShell rules against `.ps1` files, etc. Existing rule sets need no changes; they continue to behave as bash-only.
- Broad Bash allowlists like `Bash(python3 *)` or `Bash(pwsh *)` are now viable in your Claude Code permissions: with content-level matching in place, ClaudeWatch catches the destructive variants regardless of how the script reaches the shell, so blanket `Bash(...)` permission no longer means blanket trust of the script's contents.

### Other
- `SPEC.md` and `docs/schema.md` document the new requirements (`EN-12`/`EN-13` for Write/Edit handling, `RL-10..13` for `target`, `RS-07`/`RS-08` for `extensions`, `HK-01` updated for the `Write|Edit` matcher, `SH-08`/`SH-09` for the two new shipped rule sets) and the user-facing YAML schema for `target` and `extensions`.
- Engine and rule-set test coverage extended to exercise target dispatch (bash-only, file-only, default), extension gating with case-insensitive matching, Edit content reconstruction with and without an on-disk file (including `replace_all`), invalid-target diagnostics, and silent handling of unsupported tool names.

## 0.4.2

### Fixes
- The watchdog hook now logs malformed-JSON input to stderr instead of failing silently, making bad-payload incidents diagnosable.

### Other
- Plugin description in `plugin.json` no longer says "enforce" (typo) or "claude-watches" (wrong tool name); now reads "enforces command safety rules via 'claude-watchdog'".
- Added internal contributor docs — `SPEC.md` (formal contract), `STATUS.md` (spec-coverage audit), and `AGENTS.md` (build philosophy) — so future agent sessions and human contributors have a reading order. `CLAUDE.md` now imports `AGENTS.md`.

## 0.4.1

### Fixes
- The watch-secrets `env` / `printenv` ask-rule no longer triggers on hyphenated tokens like `data-env` or `printenv-extra` appearing in comments or filenames. The previous regex used `\b...\b` boundaries, which treat hyphens as word separators; the rule now requires shell command boundaries (start of line, whitespace, `;`, `&&`, `|`, backtick, parens) on both sides.

## 0.4.0

### Other
- Adopted the `SessionStart` cli-freshness hook pattern from the chris-peterson plugin namespace for symmetry. ClaudeWatch is a pure-hook plugin with no `install-cli` wrapper to drift, so the handler is intentionally empty (one comment, `exit 0`); it exists as a placeholder for future plugin-update self-checks specific to a hook plugin (e.g., verifying `watchdog.py` emits the expected `permissionDecision` schema — the kind of regression that shipped silently in 0.2.0).

## 0.3.0

### Other
- Established `plugin.json` as the single source of truth for the version. The project is moving to a main-only release model with no version tags; existing tags (`1.0.0`, `0.0.2`) will be deleted separately.
- Added an "Updating" section to the README documenting the auto-update path for end users.

## 0.2.1

### Fixes
- Ask-rules now actually prompt the user. Prior versions emitted the legacy hook output schema, which Claude Code silently treated as no-op for `ask` decisions — meaning every ask-rule (`git push`, `git commit`, `npm install`, etc.) was allowed through without confirmation. Updated to the current `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision` schema; both `deny` and `ask` decisions now route through it.
