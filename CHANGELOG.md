# Changelog

## 0.2.1

### Fixes
- Ask-rules now actually prompt the user. Prior versions emitted the legacy hook output schema, which Claude Code silently treated as no-op for `ask` decisions — meaning every ask-rule (`git push`, `git commit`, `npm install`, etc.) was allowed through without confirmation. Updated to the current `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision` schema; both `deny` and `ask` decisions now route through it.
