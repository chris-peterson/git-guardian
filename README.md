A Claude Code plugin that enforces command and script safety rules via a `PreToolUse` hook on `Bash`, `Write`, and `Edit`.

Claude Code's built-in permission system uses naive string matching that [fails for compound commands, heredocs, and flag reordering](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/30519). `ClaudeWatch` solves this with Python regex rules matched anywhere in the command string (or in the body of a script being written/edited) via `re.search()`.

## Rule Sets

The plugin ships these rule sets, each a standalone YAML file auto-discovered by the `watchdog` engine:

| Rule set | File | What it guards |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **watch-git** | `rules/watch-git.yml` | Force push, reset --hard, branch -D, and other destructive git ops (block); add, commit, push, and other mutating ops (ask) |
| **watch-installs** | `rules/watch-installs.yml` | curl\|sh, global installs, sudo pip/apt (block); npm install, yarn add, pip install, and other dependency changes (ask) |
| **watch-files** | `rules/watch-files.yml` | rm -rf /, chmod 777, shred, mv /dev/null (block); rm -rf, recursive chmod/chown (ask) |
| **watch-secrets** | `rules/watch-secrets.yml` | cat SSH keys, cloud credentials, echo secrets (block); cat dotfiles, .env files, env/printenv (ask) |
| **watch-pwsh** | `rules/watch-pwsh.yml` | Format-Volume, Restart-Computer, IWR \| iex (block); Remove-Item -Recurse -Force, Stop-Process -Force, Out-File to sensitive paths (ask). Applies to both `pwsh -Command "..."` bash invocations and `.ps1`/`.psm1`/`.psd1` file content authored via Write/Edit |
| **watch-python** | `rules/watch-python.yml` | shutil.rmtree at root/$HOME, pickle.loads, `__import__('os').system`, subprocess shell=True with destructive payload (block); eval, exec, os.system, os.remove, generic shell=True (ask). Applies to both `python3 -c "..."` bash invocations and `.py` file content authored via Write/Edit |

Each rule set has an optional `filter` regex that short-circuits bash commands outside its domain. Rule sets targeting script bodies declare `extensions` to gate which `Write`/`Edit` payloads they evaluate. To add a new rule set, drop a YAML file in `rules/`. To disable one, rename it to `*.yml.disabled`.

## Pairing with Bash permissions

Agents routinely generate one-off scripts to complete tasks — both inline (`python3 -c "..."`, `pwsh -Command "..."`) and as authored files (`Write` of a `.py` or `.ps1`). Reviewing every such invocation through a permission prompt is impractical: the script body is opaque in the prompt, and clicking "allow" doesn't reflect real consent.

ClaudeWatch's regex matching reaches anywhere in the command string and into the body of `Write`/`Edit` payloads, which covers cases Claude Code's built-in `startsWith` rules can't see. That makes it safe to broaden your Bash allowlist for the interpreters agents reach for, and let ClaudeWatch be the safety net that blocks destructive variants (`shutil.rmtree` at filesystem roots, `Format-Volume`, `Invoke-WebRequest | iex`, etc.):

```jsonc
// .claude/settings.json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(python3 *)",
      "Bash(pwsh *)"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Installation

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/chris-peterson/claude-marketplace
claude plugin install ClaudeWatch@chris-peterson
```

## Updating

Third-party Claude Code marketplaces have auto-update **off by default**. Either:

- **Enable auto-update once** via `/plugin` → Marketplaces → `chris-peterson` → Enable auto-update. Future releases install on the next session start.
- **Or update manually** with `claude plugin update ClaudeWatch@chris-peterson`.

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for release notes.

## Documentation

See the [docs site](https://chris-peterson.github.io/ClaudeWatch/) for usage, configuration, and the full [default rules](https://chris-peterson.github.io/ClaudeWatch/#/rules) reference.

In-session, run `/ClaudeWatch:help` for an overview or `/ClaudeWatch:rules` to view and edit rules interactively.

## Development

```bash
just test                          # run the test suite
just docs                          # regenerate docs from rules
just rules                         # interactive rules editor
claude --plugin-dir .              # test the plugin locally
```
