# ClaudeWatch

A Claude Code plugin that enforces command safety rules via a `PreToolUse` hook.

Claude Code's built-in permission system uses naive string matching that [fails for compound commands, heredocs, and flag reordering](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/30519). A block rule on `git push --force` won't catch `git push -f`. A block rule on `git commit` won't fire when the command is `git add . && git commit -m "oops"`.

`ClaudeWatch` solves this by intercepting every `Bash` tool call and matching against regex rules loaded from YAML config files. The engine auto-discovers all `*.yml` files in the `rules/` directory and ships four rule sets:

| Rule set | What it guards |
| --- | --- |
| **watch-git** | Force push, reset --hard, branch -D, and other destructive git ops (block); add, commit, push, and other mutating ops (ask) |
| **watch-installs** | curl\|sh, global installs, sudo pip/apt (block); npm install, yarn add, pip install, and other dependency changes (ask) |
| **watch-files** | rm -rf /, chmod 777, shred, mv /dev/null (block); rm -rf, recursive chmod/chown (ask) |
| **watch-secrets** | cat SSH keys, cloud credentials, echo secrets (block); cat dotfiles, .env files, env/printenv (ask) |

For each matched command:

- **Block** — destructive operations are rejected outright
- **Ask** — mutating operations require user confirmation

> [!TIP]
> See the [default rules](/rules) for the full list of protected commands.

## Example

The default configuration asks to confirm `git push`, but blocks `git push -f|--force`:

`❯ git push --force`

```text
⏺ Bash(git push --force)
  ⎿  PreToolUse:Bash hook returned blocking error
  ⎿  watch-git: overwrites shared remote history — https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push#Documentation/git-push.txt--f
```

`❯ git push`

presents a confirmation dialog --

```text
 Bash command

   git push
   Push to origin/main

 This command requires approval

 Do you want to proceed?
 ❯ 1. Yes
   2. Yes, and don't ask again for: git push:*
   3. No
```

## Installation

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/chris-peterson/ClaudeWatch
claude plugin install ClaudeWatch
```

Or load directly for a single session:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chris-peterson/ClaudeWatch
claude --plugin-dir ./ClaudeWatch
```

## Customization

Rules are defined in YAML files under `rules/`. See the [default rules](/rules) reference.

> [!NOTE]
> Use the `/ClaudeWatch:rules` skill to interactively view and edit rules.
